A very simple, small and trivial terminal emulator. It fits very well
for embedded environments.

While working at O.S. Systems embedded platform we ended up requiring
few features not found in any lightwise terminal.

It is currently very light and provides the following features:

* XEmbed
* full screen
* specific start command
* terminal window resize
